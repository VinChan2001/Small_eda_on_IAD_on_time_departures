- **Normal Operations Average**: 12.10 minutes delay
- **Volume**: 3,592 flights during Thanksgiving weeks vs 89,058 normal flights
- **Insight**: Reduced business traffic and optimized holiday schedules improve operational efficiency

### ‚úàÔ∏è Story 3: Long-Haul Advantage - Duration-Based Delay Patterns
**Key Finding**: Ultra-long flights (6+ hours) have the **lowest average delays** at 17.54 minutes

![Flight Duration Analysis](story3_duration_patterns.png)

- **Flight Categories**:
  - Short-haul (<2h): Majority of operations
  - Ultra-long (6h+): 447 flights, primarily to Hawaii (HNL)
- **Pattern**: Longer flights receive priority treatment and include buffer time
- **Insight**: IAD's operational focus on international/long-haul routes shows in delay management

### üíº Story 4: Friday Evening Crunch - Business Travel Asymmetry
**Key Finding**: Friday evening delays are **4.3x higher** than Monday morning

![Business Travel Patterns](story4_business_patterns.png)

- **Monday Morning Rush** (6-10 AM): 4,915 flights, 5.15 min average delay
- **Friday Evening Rush** (4-8 PM): 4,776 flights, 22.31 min average delay
- **Peak Delay Day**: Friday (13.69 minutes average)
- **Top Business Routes**: ATL (6,086 weekday flights), LAX (5,210), SFO (5,010)
- **Insight**: Capital region's government/business cycle creates predictable weekly congestion

### ü¶† Story 5: COVID-19 Aviation Crisis - Resilience and Recovery
**Impact**: **54% flight reduction** in 2020, followed by **103% recovery** by 2021-2024

![COVID Impact Analysis](story5_covid_impact.png)

- **Pre-COVID Average**: ~12,000 flights/year (2017-2019)
- **2020 Impact**: Dramatic reduction during pandemic
- **Recovery**: Post-COVID operations exceed pre-pandemic levels
- **Insight**: IAD's role as an international gateway demonstrated remarkable resilience

### üîß Story 6: West Coast Tech Corridor - Government-Silicon Valley Pipeline
**Key Finding**: **21% of all IAD flights** go to West Coast tech hubs

![Tech Corridor Analysis](story6_tech_corridor.png)

- **Total Tech Flights**: 19,867 flights to SFO, LAX, SEA, SJC, OAK, BUR, PDX
- **Top Destination**: SFO with 6,941 flights
- **Delay Performance**: 12.26 min average (slightly higher than overall 11.70 min)
- **Peak Travel**: Monday business connections suggest government-tech sector collaboration
- **Insight**: Strong corridor between DC's government sector and West Coast innovation centers
